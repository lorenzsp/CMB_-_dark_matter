  abstract = {These lectures aim at providing an introduction to the properties of gravitational waves and in particular to those gravitational waves that are expected as a consequence of perturbations of black holes and neutron stars. Imprinted in the gravitational radiation emitted by these objects is, in fact, a wealth of physical information. In the case of black holes, a detailed knowledge of the gravitational radiation emitted as a response to perturbations will reveal us important details about their mass and spin, but also about the fundamental properties of the event horizon. In the case of neutron stars, on the other hand, this information can provide a detailed map of their internal structure and tell us about the equation of state of matter at very high density, thus filling-in a gap in energies and densities that cannot be investigated by experiments in terrestrial laboratories.},

  abstract = {We present three-dimensional simulations of the dynamics of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers from the late stage of the inspiral process up to \$$\backslash$sim 20\$ ms after the system has merged, either to form a hyper-massive neutron star (NS) or a rotating black hole (BH). We investigate five equal-mass models of total gravitational mass \$2.207\$, \$2.373\$, \$2.537\$, \$2.697\$ and \$2.854 M\_$\backslash$odot\$, respectively, and four unequal mass models with \$M\_\{$\backslash$mathrm\{ADM\}\}$\backslash$simeq 2.53$\backslash$ M\_$\backslash$odot\$ and \$q$\backslash$simeq 0.94\$, \$0.88\$, \$0.82\$, and \$0.77\$ (where \$q = M\^\{(1)\}/M\^\{(2)\}\$ is the mass ratio). We use a semi-realistic equation of state (EOS) namely, the seven-segment piece-wise polytropic SLyPP with a thermal component given by \$$\backslash$Gamma\_\{th\} = 1.8\$. We have also compared the resulting dynamics (for one model) using both, the BSSN-NOK and CCZ4 methods for the evolution of the gravitational sector, and also different reconstruction methods for the matter sector, namely PPM, WENO and MP5. Our results show agreement and high resolution, but superiority of BSSN-NOK supplemented by WENO reconstruction at lower resolutions. One of the important characteristics of the present investigation is that, for the first time, this has been done using only publicly available open source software, in particular, the Einstein Toolkit code deployed for the dynamical evolution and the LORENE code for the generation of the initial models. All of the source code and parameters used for the simulations have been made publicly available. This not only makes it possible to re-run and re-analyze our data; it also enables others to directly build upon this work for future research.},

  abstract = {The recent detections of gravitational waves by the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors open up new tests of modified gravity theories in the strong-field and dynamical, extreme gravity regime. Such tests rely sensitively on the phase evolution of the gravitational waves, which is controlled by the energy-momentum carried by such waves out of the system. We here study four different methods for finding the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor in gravity theories with any combination of scalar, vector, or tensor degrees of freedom. These methods rely on the second variation of the action under short-wavelength averaging, the second perturbation of the field equations in the short-wavelength approximation, the construction of an energy complex leading to a Landau-Lifshitz tensor, and the use of Noether's theorem in field theories about a flat background. We apply these methods in General Relativity, scalar-tensor theories and Einstein-$\backslash$AE\{\}ther theory to find the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor and calculate the rate at which energy and linear momentum is carried away from the system. The stress-energy tensor and the rate of linear momentum loss in Einstein-$\backslash$AE\{\}ther theory are presented here for the first time. We find that all methods yield the same rate of energy loss, although the stress-energy pseudo-tensor can be functionally different. We also find that the Noether method yields a stress-energy tensor that is not symmetric or gauge-invariant, and symmetrization via the Belinfante procedure does not fix these problems because this procedure relies on Lorentz invariance, which is spontaneously broken in Einstein-$\backslash$AE\{\}ther theory. The methods and results found here will be useful for the calculation of predictions in modified gravity theories that can then be contrasted with observations.},

  abstract = {We present results of more than three decades of timing measurements of the first known binary pulsar, PSR B1913+16. Like most other pulsars, its rotational behavior over such long time scales is significantly affected by small-scale irregularities not explicitly accounted for in a deterministic model. Nevertheless, the physically important astrometric, spin, and orbital parameters are well determined and well decoupled from the timing noise. We have determined a significant result for proper motion, \$$\backslash$mu\_\{$\backslash$alpha\} = -1.43$\backslash$pm0.13\$, \$$\backslash$mu\_\{$\backslash$delta\}=-0.70$\backslash$pm0.13\$ mas yr\$\^\{-1\}\$. The pulsar exhibited a small timing glitch in May 2003, with \$\{$\backslash$Delta f\}/f=3.7$\backslash$times10\^\{-11\}\$, and a smaller timing peculiarity in mid-1992. A relativistic solution for orbital parameters yields improved mass estimates for the pulsar and its companion, \$m\_1=1.4398$\backslash$pm0.0002 $\backslash$ M\_\{$\backslash$sun\}\$ and \$m\_2=1.3886$\backslash$pm0.0002 $\backslash$ M\_\{$\backslash$sun\}\$. The system's orbital period has been decreasing at a rate \$0.997$\backslash$pm0.002\$ times that predicted as a result of gravitational radiation damping in general relativity. As we have shown before, this result provides conclusive evidence for the existence of gravitational radiation as predicted by Einstein's theory.},

Together with the Keplerian orbital parameters, measurements of the relativistic periastron advance and a combination of gravitational redshift and time dilation yield the stellar masses with high accuracy. The measured rate of change of orbital period agrees with that expected from the emission of gravitational radiation, according to general relativity, to within about 0.2 percent. Systematic effects depending on the pulsar distance and on poorly known galactic constants now dominate the error budget, so tighter bounds will be difficult to obtain. Geodetic precession of the pulsar spin axis leads to secular changes in pulse shape as the pulsar-observer geometry changes. This effect makes it possible to model the two-dimensional structure of the beam. We find that the beam is elongated in the latitude direction and appears to be pinched in longitude near its center.},

The computations are performed for both cases of synchronized and irrotational binary systems with adiabatic indices \$$\backslash$gamma=3,\textasciitilde{}2.5,\textasciitilde{}2.25,\textasciitilde{}2\$ and 1.8.

The evolution of fluid configurations is described using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), and the elliptic field equations of the CF formalism are solved using spectral methodsin spherical coordinates. The code was tested on models for which the CF limit is exact, finding good agreement with the classical Oppenheimer-Volkov solution for a relativistic static spherical star as well as the exact semi-analytic solution for a collapsing spherical dust cloud. By computing the evolution of quasi-equilibrium neutron star binary configurations in the absence of gravitational radiation backreaction, we have confirmed that these configurations can remain dynamically stable all the way to the development of a cusp. With an approximate treatment of radiation reaction, we have calculated the complete merger of an irrotational binary configuration from the innermost point on an equilibrium sequence through merger and remnant formation and ringdown, finding good agreement withprevious relativistic calculations. In particular, we find that mass loss is highly suppressed by relativistic effects, but that, for a reasonably stiff neutron star equation of state, the remnant is initially stable against gravitational collapse because of its strong differential rotation. The gravity wave signal derived from our numerical calculation has an energy spectrum which matches extremely well with estimates based solely on quasi-equilibrium results, deviating from the Newtonian power-law form at frequencies below 1 kHz, i.e., within the reach of advanced interferometric detectors.},

  abstract = {Quasiequilibrium sequences of binary neutron stars are numerically calculated in the framework of the Isenberg-Wilson-Mathews (IWM) approximation of general relativity. The results are presented for both rotation states of synchronized spins and irrotational motion, the latter being considered as the realistic one for binary neutron stars just prior to the merger. We assume a polytropic equation of state and compute several evolutionary sequences of binary systems composed of different-mass stars as well as identical-mass stars with adiabatic indices gamma=2.5, 2.25, 2, and 1.8. From our results, we propose as a conjecture that if the turning point of binding energy (and total angular momentum) locating the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) is found in Newtonian gravity for some value of the adiabatic index gamma\_0, that of the ADM mass (and total angular momentum) should exist in the IWM approximation of general relativity for the same value of the adiabatic index.},

We investigate five equal-mass models of total gravitational mass \$2.207\$, \$2.373\$, \$2.537\$, \$2.697\$ and \$2.854 M\_$\backslash$odot\$, respectively, and four unequal mass models with \$M\_\{$\backslash$mathrm\{ADM\}\}$\backslash$simeq 2.53$\backslash$ M\_$\backslash$odot\$ and \$q$\backslash$simeq 0.94\$, \$0.88\$, \$0.82\$, and \$0.77\$ (where \$q = M\^\{(1)\}/M\^\{(2)\}\$ is the mass ratio). We use a semi-realistic equation of state (EOS) namely, the seven-segment piece-wise polytropic SLyPP with a thermal component given by \$$\backslash$Gamma\_\{th\} = 1.8\$. We have also compared the resulting dynamics (for one model) using both, the BSSN-NOK and CCZ4 methods for the evolution of the gravitational sector, and also different reconstruction methods for the matter sector, namely PPM, WENO and MP5. Our results show agreement and high resolution, but superiority of BSSN-NOK supplemented by WENO reconstruction at lower resolutions. One of the important characteristics of the present investigation is that, for the first time, this has been done using only publicly available open source software, in particular, the Einstein Toolkit code deployed for the dynamical evolution and the LORENE code for the generation of the initial models. All of the source code and parameters used for the simulations have been made publicly available. This not only makes it possible to re-run and re-analyze our data; it also enables others to directly build upon this work for future research.},

Since gravitational radiation is properly defined only at null infinity and in an appropriate coordinate system, the accurate estimation of the emitted gravitational waves represents an old and non-trivial problem in numerical relativity. A number of methods have been developed over the years to "extract" the radiative part of the solution from a numerical simulation and these include: quadrupole formulas, gauge-invariant metric perturbations, Weyl scalars, and characteristic extraction. We review and discuss each method, in terms of both its theoretical background as well as its implementation.

The GRMHD extension of the Toolkit builds upon previous releases and implements the evolution of relativistic magnetised fluids in the ideal MHD limit in fully dynamical spacetimes using the same shock-capturing techniques previously applied to hydrodynamical evolution. In order to maintain the divergence-free character of the magnetic field, the code implements both hyperbolic divergence cleaning and constrained transport schemes. We present test results for a number of MHD tests in Minkowski and curved spacetimes. Minkowski tests include aligned and oblique planar shocks, cylindrical explosions, magnetic rotors, Alfv$\backslash$'en waves and advected loops, as well as a set of tests designed to study the response of the divergence cleaning scheme to numerically generated monopoles. We study the code's performance in curved spacetimes with spherical accretion onto a black hole on a fixed background spacetime and in fully dynamical spacetimes by evolutions of a magnetised polytropic neutron star and of the collapse of a magnetised stellar core. Our results agree well with exact solutions where these are available and we demonstrate convergence. All code and input files used to generate the results are available on http://einsteintoolkit.org.

Since then, much has been going on in the field with a lot of work focussing on the observations and implications for astrophysics and tests of general relativity in the strong regime. However much less is understood about how gravitational detectors really work at their fundamental level. For decades, the response to incoming signals has been customarily calculated using the very same physical principle, which has proved so successful in the first detections. In this paper we review the physical principle that is behind such a detection at the very fundamental level, and we try to highlight the peculiar subtleties that make it so hard in practice. We will then mention how detectors are built starting from this fundamental measurement element.},

These conditions are equality of ADM and Komar mass at infinity and equality of the ADM and a rescaled Komar mass at each puncture. In this paper we explicitly give results for the case of an equal mass black hole binary without spin, but our approach can also be applied in the general case. We find that up to numerical accuracy the apparent horizon mass also remains constant along the sequence and that the prediction for the innermost stable circular orbit is similar to what has been found with the effective potential method.},

  abstract = {Gravitational waves are propagating fluctuations of gravitational fields, that is, ''ripples'' in spacetime, generated mainly by moving massive bodies. These distortions of spacetime travel with the speed of light. Every body in the path of such a wave feels a tidal gravitational force that acts perpendicular to the waves direction of propagation; these forces change the distance between points, and the size of the changes is proportional to the distance between the points. Gravitational waves can be detected by devices which measure the induced length changes. The frequencies and the amplitudes of the waves are related to the motion of the masses involved. Thus, the analysis of gravitational waveforms allows us to learn about their source and, if there are more than two detectors involved in observation, to estimate the distance and position of their source on the sky.},

[Classical Quantum Gravity 33, 175009 (2016)], and Feo et al. [Classical Quantum Gravity 34, 034001 (2017)], and allow us to study the effect of the total baryonic mass of such systems (from \$2.4 M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$ to \$3 M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$), the mass ratio (up to \$q = 0.77\$), and the neutron star equation of state, both in equal and highly unequal mass binaries. We use the peaks we find in the gravitational spectrum as an independent test of already published hypotheses of their physical origin and empirical relations linking them with the characteristics of the merging neutron stars. In particular, we highlight the effects of the mass ratio, which in the past was often neglected. We also analyze the temporal evolution of the emission frequencies. Finally, we introduce a modern variant of Prony's method to analyze the gravitational wave postmerger emission as a sum of complex exponentials, trying to overcome some drawbacks of both Fourier spectra and least-squares fitting. Overall, the spectral properties of the postmerger signal observed in our simulation are in agreement with those proposed by other groups. More specifically, we find that the analysis of Bauswein and Stergioulas [Phys. Rev. D 91, 124056 (2015)] is particularly effective for binaries with very low masses or with a small mass ratio and that the mechanical toy model of Takami et al. [Phys. Rev.

  abstract = {We present results from three-dimensional general relativistic simulations of binary neutron star coalescences and mergers using public codes. We considered equal mass models where the baryon mass of the two Neutron Stars (NS) is \$1.4M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$, described by four different equations of state (EOS) for the cold nuclear matter (APR4, SLy, H4, and MS1; all parametrized as piecewise polytropes). We started the simulations from four different initial interbinary distances (\$40, 44.3, 50\$, and \$60\$ km), including up to the last 16 orbits before merger. That allows to show the effects on the gravitational wave phase evolution, radiated energy and angular momentum due to: the use of different EOSs, the orbital eccentricity present in the initial data and the initial separation (in the simulation) between the two stars. Our results show that eccentricity has a major role in the discrepancy between numerical and analytical waveforms until the very last few orbits, where "tidal" effects and missing high-order post-Newtonian coefficients also play a significant role. We test different methods for extrapolating the gravitational wave signal extracted at finite radii to null infinity. We show that an effective procedure for integrating the Newman-Penrose \$$\backslash$psi\_4\$ signal to obtain the gravitational wave strain \$h\$ is to apply a simple high-pass digital filter to \$h\$ after a time domain integration, where only the two physical motivated integration constants are introduced. That should be preferred to the more common procedures of introducing additional integration constants, integrating in the frequency domain or filtering \$$\backslash$psi\_4\$ before integration.},

We outline the merits of and differences between the various quantities used for parameterizing noise curves and characterizing gravitational-wave amplitudes.

Documentation for the toolkit and its several modules is often scattered across different locations, a difficulty new users may at times have to struggle with. Scientific papers exist describing the toolkit and its methods in detail, but they might be overwhelming at first. With these lecture notes we hope to provide an initial overview for new users. We cover how to obtain, compile and run the toolkit, and give an overview of some of the tools and modules provided with it.},

  title = {Einstein's {{Discovery}} of {{Gravitational Waves}} 1916-1918},
  abstract = {In his 1916 ground-breaking general relativity paper Einstein had imposed a restrictive coordinate condition, his field equations were valid for coordinate systems which are unimodular. Later, Einstein published a paper on gravitational waves. The solution presented in this paper did not satisfy the above restrictive condition. In his gravitational waves paper, Einstein concluded that gravitational fields propagate at the speed of light. The solution is the Minkowski flat metric plus a small disturbance propagating in a flat spacetime. Einstein calculated the small deviation from Minkowski metric in a manner analogous to that of retarded potentials in electrodynamics. However, in obtaining the above derivation, Einstein made a mathematical error. This error caused him to obtain three different types of waves compatible with his approximate field equations: longitudinal waves, transverse waves and a new type of wave. Einstein added an Addendum in which he suggested that in systems in unimodular coordinates only waves of the third type occur and these waves transport energy. He became obsessed with his unimodular coordinates. Einstein's colleagues demonstrated to him that in the coordinate system in unimodular coordinates the gravitational wave of a mass point carry no energy, but Einstein tried to persuade them that he had actually not made a mistake in his gravitational waves paper. Einstein, however, eventually accepted his colleagues results and dropped the restrictive unimodular coordinates. This finally led him to discover plane transverse gravitational waves.},

Introducing appropriate coordinates, these methods exhibit rapid convergence of the conformal factor and lead to highly accurate solutions. As an application we investigate small mass ratios of binary black holes and compare these with the corresponding test mass limit that we obtain through a semianalytical limiting procedure. In particular, we compare the binding energy of puncture data in this limit with that of a test particle in the Schwarzschild spacetime and find that it deviates by 50\% from the Schwarzschild result at the innermost stable circular orbit of Schwarzschild, if the ADM mass at each puncture is used to define the local black hole masses.},

In particular, it is shown that the only non-vanishing components of the wave field in the conventional traceless-transverse gauge in linearized general relativity do not enter the geodesic deviation equation, and therefore, apparently, no effect is predicted by that equation in that specific gauge. The reason is traced back to the fact that the geodesic deviation equation is written in terms of a coordinate distance, which is not a directly measurable quantity. On the other hand, in the proper Lorentz frame of the detector, the conventional result described in standard textbooks holds.},

  abstract = {Dark matter (DM) annihilation during hydrogen recombination (z \textasciitilde{} 1000) will alter the recombination history of the Universe, and affect the observed CMB temperature and polarization fluctuations. Unlike other astrophysical probes of DM, this is free of the significant uncertainties in modelling galactic physics, and provides a method to detect and constrain the cosmological abundances of these particles. We parametrize the effect of DM annihilation as an injection of ionizing energy at a rate e\_\{dm\}, and argue that this simple "on the spot'' modification is a good approximation to the complicated interaction of the annihilation products with the photon-electron plasma. Generic models of DM do not change the redshift of recombination, but change the residual ionization after recombination. This broadens the surface of last scattering, suppressing the temperature fluctuations and enhancing the polarization fluctuations. We use the temperature and polarization angular power spectra to measure these deviations from the standard recombination history, and therefore, indirectly probe DM annihilation. (abridged)},

  abstract = {Modern Cosmology begins with an introduction to the smooth, homogeneous universe described by a Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric, including careful treatments of dark energy, big bang nucleosynthesis, recombination, and dark matter. From this starting point, the reader is introduced to perturbations about an FRW universe: their evolution with the Einstein-Boltzmann equations, their generation by primordial inflation, and their observational consequences. These consequences include the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) featuring acoustic peaks and polarization, the matter power spectrum with baryonic wiggles, and their detection via photometric galaxy surveys, redshift distortions, cluster abundances, and weak lensing. The book concludes with a long chapter on data analysis. Modern Cosmology is the first book to explain in detail the structure of the acoustic peaks in the CMB, the E/B decomposition in polarization which may allow for detection of primordial gravity waves, and the modern analysis techniques used on increasingly large cosmological data sets. Readers will gain the tools needed to work in cosmology and learn how modern observations are rapidly revolutionizing our picture of the universe.Provides foundations, calculations, and interpretations which illuminate current thinking in cosmologyCovers the major advances in cosmology over the past decadeIncludes over 100 unique, pedagogical figures},

We review the acoustic phenomenology that forms the cornerstone of the standard cosmological model and discuss internal consistency relations which lend credence to its interpretation. We discuss future milestones in the study of CMB anisotropy that have implications for inflationary and dark energy models.
