  abstract = {Dark matter (DM) annihilation during hydrogen recombination (z \textasciitilde{} 1000) will alter the recombination history of the Universe, and affect the observed CMB temperature and polarization fluctuations. Unlike other astrophysical probes of DM, this is free of the significant uncertainties in modelling galactic physics, and provides a method to detect and constrain the cosmological abundances of these particles. We parametrize the effect of DM annihilation as an injection of ionizing energy at a rate e\_\{dm\}, and argue that this simple "on the spot'' modification is a good approximation to the complicated interaction of the annihilation products with the photon-electron plasma. Generic models of DM do not change the redshift of recombination, but change the residual ionization after recombination. This broadens the surface of last scattering, suppressing the temperature fluctuations and enhancing the polarization fluctuations. We use the temperature and polarization angular power spectra to measure these deviations from the standard recombination history, and therefore, indirectly probe DM annihilation. (abridged)},

  isbn = {978-0-12-219141-1},
  abstract = {Modern Cosmology begins with an introduction to the smooth, homogeneous universe described by a Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric, including careful treatments of dark energy, big bang nucleosynthesis, recombination, and dark matter. From this starting point, the reader is introduced to perturbations about an FRW universe: their evolution with the Einstein-Boltzmann equations, their generation by primordial inflation, and their observational consequences. These consequences include the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) featuring acoustic peaks and polarization, the matter power spectrum with baryonic wiggles, and their detection via photometric galaxy surveys, redshift distortions, cluster abundances, and weak lensing. The book concludes with a long chapter on data analysis. Modern Cosmology is the first book to explain in detail the structure of the acoustic peaks in the CMB, the E/B decomposition in polarization which may allow for detection of primordial gravity waves, and the modern analysis techniques used on increasingly large cosmological data sets. Readers will gain the tools needed to work in cosmology and learn how modern observations are rapidly revolutionizing our picture of the universe.Provides foundations, calculations, and interpretations which illuminate current thinking in cosmologyCovers the major advances in cosmology over the past decadeIncludes over 100 unique, pedagogical figures},

  abstract = {The tremendous experimental progress in cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy studies over the last few years has helped establish a standard paradigm for cosmology at intermediate epochs and has simultaneously raised questions regarding the physical processes at the two opposite ends of time. What is the physics behind the source of structure in the universe and the dark energy that is currently accelerating its expansion? We review the acoustic phenomenology that forms the cornerstone of the standard cosmological model and discuss internal consistency relations which lend credence to its interpretation. We discuss future milestones in the study of CMB anisotropy that have implications for inflationary and dark energy models. These include signatures of gravitational waves and gravitational lensing in the polarization fields and secondary temperature anisotropy from the transit of CMB photons across the large-scale structure of the universe.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \$$\backslash$Omega\_c h\^2 = 0.120$\backslash$pm 0.001\$, baryon density \$$\backslash$Omega\_b h\^2 = 0.0224$\backslash$pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965$\backslash$pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \$$\backslash$tau = 0.054$\backslash$pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68$\backslash$,$\backslash$\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95$\backslash$,$\backslash$\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03$\backslash$,$\backslash$\%\$ precision, with \$100$\backslash$theta\_*=1.0411$\backslash$pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4$\backslash$pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \$$\backslash$Omega\_m = 0.315$\backslash$pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \$$\backslash$sigma\_8 = 0.811$\backslash$pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{$\backslash$rm eff\} = 2.99$\backslash$pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \$$\backslash$sum m\_$\backslash$nu$<$ 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM at over \$2$\backslash$,$\backslash$sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.
