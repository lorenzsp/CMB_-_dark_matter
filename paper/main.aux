In the middle panel, the monopole component has been subtracted. Apart from some slight contamination from the galaxy near the equator (corre- sponding to the plane of our Galaxy), one sees only a nearly perfect dipole pattern, owing to our peculiar motion with respect to the rest frame defined by the CMB. In the bottom panel, both the monopole and dipole components have been removed.
