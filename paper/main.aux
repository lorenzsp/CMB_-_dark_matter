The top panel shows the microwave sky as seen on a linear tem- perature scale including zero. No anisotropies are visible in this image, because the CMB monopole at 2.725K dominates. In the middle panel, the monopole component has been subtracted. Apart from some slight contamination from the galaxy near the equator (corre- sponding to the plane of our Galaxy), one sees only a nearly perfect dipole pattern, owing to our peculiar motion with respect to the rest frame defined by the CMB. In the bottom panel, both the monopole and dipole components have been removed. Except for the galactic contamination around the equator, one sees the cosmic microwave background anisotropy along with some noise. (Credit: NASA/COBE Science Team)}}{5}{figure.4}}
